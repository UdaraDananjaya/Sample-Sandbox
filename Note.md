To create a Vuetify project using `npm create`

### Step 1: Install NPM (Node Package Manager)

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can check this by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If you don't have Node.js and npm installed, download and install them from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Step 2: Create a New Project

Run the following command in your terminal to create a new Vuetify project. This command will prompt you to choose a preset. For a basic setup, you can select the default preset.

```bash
npx create-vuetify@latest
```

During the setup process, you'll be asked several questions about your project configuration, such as the project name, version, description, etc. Answer these prompts according to your preferences.

### Step 3: Navigate to Your Project Directory

After creating the project, navigate into your project directory:

```bash
cd <your-project-name>
```

Replace `<your-project-name>` with the actual name of your project.

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

Before starting the development server, ensure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm install
```

This command installs all necessary packages listed in your `package.json` file.

### Step 5: Run the Development Server

Start the development server to see your Vuetify application in action:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command compiles and hot-reloads for development. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to view your Vuetify project.
